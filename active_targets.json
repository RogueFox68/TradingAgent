The company has also maintained its dividend payout, which is attractive to income investors. In terms of momentum, CVX has shown steady growth in its stock price over the past year, outperforming the broader market. However, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62, indicating a moderate level of bullishness and room for potential breakouts.

Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) is 25.55%, indicating a high level of efficiency in using shareholders' equity to generate profits.

Their revenue growth has been stagnant in recent years, with a CAGR of only 2.3% over the last three years. The company's operating margin is relatively low at 23.4%, which may indicate inefficiencies in their business model. Furthermore, FIS has faced regulatory scrutiny in the past, particularly related to anti-money laundering and data security issues.
